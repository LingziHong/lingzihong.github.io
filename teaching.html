                     <h3>Teaching Summary</h3>
                     <p>My philosophy of teaching is grounded in the belief that education is not merely the transmission of knowledge, but the igniting of a lifelong passion for learning. I strive to create an environment where students are not just passive recipients of information but active, engaged learners who are inspired and motivated to explore, question, and discover.</p>

                     <p>I have consistently received positive evaluations from students. Here is a summary list of the courses I taught and the review: <a href="files/Teaching_Summary.pdf"> teaching summary</a>. </p>

                     <h4> Data Collection, Classification, and Transformation</h4>
                     <p> The internet offers a vast amount of data, necessitating an understanding of how to utilize this wealth of information more effectively. This knowledge will not only serve to advance library related research, e.g., digital resource management, data-driven library services, but also equip librarians the knowledge and skills to provide data literacy services that assist users in better comprehending and employing online data. This session will cover data collection, classification, and transformation methods using Python. For data collection, we will provide an overview of web communication through hyperlinks and APIs. Practical considerations for accessing APIs, such as obtaining credentials and making requests using Python. For data classification and transformation, we will introduce the use of open sourced large language models (LLM) such as Llama2 for the automatic classification of data into predetermined categories or hierarchies for further analysis. By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to collect, preprocess, and analyze data from online platforms, thereby enhancing their ability to conduct research and provide data related services.</p>

                     <p>Learning Objectives:</p>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Understand the basics of web data and APIs.</li>
                        <li>Acquire practical skills in using programming languages such as Python and its libraries to scrap data from webpages and APIs.</li>
                        <li>Obtain practical skills in using open sourced LLMs for automatic processing of large-scale data.</li>
                        <li>Integrate the tutorial material into their data literacy education services.</li>
                        <li>Encourage innovative thinking about how online data can support library research, and the development of new tools and services.</li>

                     <h4>  Comprehending the Semantic Essence of Text: Leveraging SEANCE for Textual Analysis</h4>
                     <p> Textual analysis has applications across various fields for interpreting and analyzing the content, structure, and context of texts. In LIS, textual analysis can be applied to digital humanity and literary analysis projects, to uncover trends, themes, and relationships within vast corpora of texts such as historical documents and digital archives. Textual analysis has wide applications in Social Sciences research in examining interview transcripts, speeches, news articles, and social media posts. This session will first introduce fundamental concepts of text mining and textual analysis tools such as SÉANCE with its indices, then introduce statistical analysis to facilitate a deeper understanding of textual analysis results. Hands-on guidance will be provided for LIS researchers and practitioners on utilizing tools such as SÉANCE for text analysis. Participants will be adept at tasks such as textual data preprocessing, linguistic indices analysis using SEANCE, and statistical analysis for insights. LIS participants will gain basic knowledge and skills that will be useful to conduct data-driven research and provide data literacy services.</p>
