                  <p>The human-centered computing lab at UNT is dedicated to advancing the field of computing by prioritizing human needs, behaviors, and experiences. </p>

                  <p>Our mission is to develop innovative methodologies for understanding and enhancing the interaction between humans and sociotechnical systems. The aim is to create technologies that are not only innovative but also deeply attuned to human needs and behaviors. </p>

                  <p>Interdisciplinary approaches, including advanced computing techniques, quantitative analysis, qualitative user studies will be employed for a holistic examination of human perception and cognition, to decipher the complex interactions between humans and sociotechnical systems. The insights are applied for decision-making and creating intuitive and empowering digital applications. By focusing on user-centered computing, we aim to ensure that technology serves to augment human potential, while being transparent and under control. </p>
                 
                  <p>Here are the three main research focus:</p>

                  <ul>
                     <li> Insights from Human-System Interaction for Decision Support </li>

                     <li> Insights from Human-System Interaction for AI Development </li>

                     <li> Human-centered Evaluation of Emerging Technologies </li>
