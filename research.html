                              Crisis events disrupt the normal functioning of individuals, groups, or systems, and can result in damaging impacts in various scenarios, including natural disasters, public health emergencies, and economic collapses. They present significant challenges or threats to the safety and well-being of individuals and can strain resources and exacerbate inequalities.

                           <p>
                              The project will identify the most in-need US counties with high immigrant ratios, high crisis risks, and low resources, which will be the study areas to investigate: RQ1: What are the information needs of immigrants in crisis in under-resourced communities? RQ2: What is the status of public services for immigrants in crisis?

                              The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about significant advancements in CV and NLP. However, the application of these technologies in traditional domains and their acceptance by users often require extended periods of time. We seek to explore the factors influencing user acceptance of specific AI applications and identify the key issues that should be considered for their successful implementation. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This project will conduct experiments to identify the performance of LLMs in traditional cataloging tasks. Then, we will conduct user studies based on the conceptual framework to identify the factors relevant to librarians' acceptance of LLM in assisting cataloging. We will also conduct interactive user designs to identify how LLMs can be applied to assist librarians.

                              Phase 1 project focuses on examining the perspectives of community college librarians, faculty, and students regarding data literacy. This phase seeks to identify the specific data literacy competencies required for student success, laying a foundation for informed strategies to address these needs effectively.

                              Phase 2 project aims to position community college librarians as key leaders in data literacy education. Through training, resources, and collaboration, this phase equips librarians to foster data literacy success among students, strengthening library capacity as a cornerstone of institutional support.
